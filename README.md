## Water-Quality-Analysis-Final-Year-Project

This project utilizes advanced image processing techniques to analyze water samples and assess water quality by detecting and classifying particles such as bacteria, algae, and sediment. With the aim of providing a non-invasive, efficient, and accessible method for water quality monitoring, this system analyzes water sample images to identify contaminants and generate water quality metrics.

#Overview
The system combines various image processing techniques to capture and analyze water sample images, detect particles, classify contaminants, and evaluate overall water quality. By correlating particle size, shape, and density with known water quality standards, the system can estimate contamination levels and suggest drinkability based on widely accepted guidelines (e.g., WHO, EPA).

# Features
Image Acquisition and Preprocessing: Captures water sample images, reduces noise, and enhances contrast for better detection.
Particle Detection and Classification: Uses adaptive thresholding, morphological transformations, and contour detection to identify particles.
Water Quality Metrics Calculation: Calculates metrics such as particle density, estimated turbidity, and suspended solids.
Drinkability Assessment: Compares results with water quality standards to provide a drinkability rating.
Particle Type Breakdown: Classifies and analyzes particles by type, including bacteria, algae, and sediment.
# Methodology
Image Acquisition: Captures high-resolution images of water samples with consistent lighting and calibration.
Preprocessing: Enhances image quality using noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and segmentation techniques.
Detection and Classification: Identifies particles based on size, shape, and color properties to classify contaminants.
Water Quality Analysis: Quantifies particle density and assesses overall quality based on standard guidelines.
# Results and Discussion
The system provides insights into:

Particle size distribution and type, with a breakdown by bacteria, algae, and sediment.
Key water quality indicators, including particle density and turbidity, correlated with established standards.
Visual outputs of detected particles for manual verification.
Limitations and Future Improvements
Current Limitations: Detection accuracy may be affected by lighting inconsistencies and overlapping particles.
Future Directions: Integrate machine learning for advanced classification and explore multi-spectral imaging to detect transparent particles.
